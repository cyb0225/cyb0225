  - The functionalities are similar to the 3rd training camp, with the addition of a private messaging module.
  - Using microservice architecture（[go-zero](https://github.com/zeromicro/go-zero)), we implemented distributed tracing([jeager](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) + [opentelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)), service monitoring([prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)), and log collection([elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/cn/?ultron=B-Stack-Trials-APJ-Exact&gambit=Stack-Core&blade=adwords-s&hulk=paid&Device=c&thor=elasticsearch&gclid=CjwKCAiAmJGgBhAZEiwA1JZoltyLnCi1dMvN0v0q2sNoZdMqEwGAWAmaIAbkQqgvr0Jl5WosiMaPmRoCjy0QAvD_BwE)). 
  - The system was deployed to a cloud platform using Docker, and we optimized some interfaces with caching after performing load testing([go-stress-testing](https://github.com/link1st/go-stress-testing))
